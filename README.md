# Breakpoint
Breakpoint responds to screen size and applies viewport breakpoint classes to the document element. It has no dependencies.

Minified version is 917 bytes.

__Status: Working, just mulling over the class names__

# Usage

Include breakpoint.min.js in your web app in the normal way:

```<script src="breakpoint.min.js"></script>```

Breakpoint has no dependencies and can be used standalone and should not interfere with any JavaScript libraries or frameworks.

# Test Page
Download breakpoint and try out the test page where breakpoints can be edited on the fly.

# Quick Illustration

If the breakpoints array = [768]

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>At Screen Width</th>
        <th>Classes on the HTML Element</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>320</td>
        <td>lte768</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>768</td>
        <td>lte768</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1024</td>
        <td>gt768</td>
    </tr>
</table>

If the breakpoints array = [768, 320]

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>At Screen Width</th>
        <th>Classes on the HTML Element</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>320</td>
        <td>lte320 lte768</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>768</td>
        <td>gt320 gt320lte768 lte768</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1024</td>
        <td>gt320 gt768</td>
    </tr>
</table>

# Using Custom Breakpoints

Push new ones onto the default array:

```
window['https://github.com/davesmith/breakpoint'].push(456);
```

Or use a completely new set of breakpoints, which overwrites the default:

```window['https://github.com/davesmith/breakpoint'].breakpoints = [320, 768];```

# Perform a Manual Update
The update function is called when the window resizes. If the breakpoints array
is modified dynamically then update can be called without needing to resize the window.

```window['https://github.com/davesmith/breakpoint'].update();```
